# Form Fields Maintenance Guide

## Overview
This system is designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of form fields in the application.

## Adding New Field Types
1. Add the new field type to the `FieldTypeEnum` in `FieldTypeEnum.dart`.
2. Add the appropriate widget construction logic in `FormFieldBuilder.dart`.
3. Create the corresponding widget for the new field type.

## Modifying Existing Fields
To modify the properties or behavior of an existing field, locate its model in the list of fields and adjust the properties as needed.

## Fetching Form Data
To fetch the data from the form, use the `getFormData` method (or equivalent) from the main form class. It will return a Map with the form data.

## Notes
- Always test new field types or modifications thoroughly to ensure they work correctly in the form.
- If adding complex validation or behavior to a field, consider encapsulating that logic within the field's widget to keep the main form logic clean and simple.
